Tips
-----

- zsh-completions and zsh-autosuggestions work together to boost CLI efficiency. Once "->" is pressed, the full command line will be completed which helps a lot. However, only part of the full command line is expected sometimes, to achieve this goal:

  * Press "Ctrl ->" to prompt word by word;
  * Press "Ctrl <-" to go back word by word.
